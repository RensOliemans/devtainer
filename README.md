My personal development docker container base image

# Motivation


This container comes pre-built with all of my favorite command line tools that I use most often.  I was getting sick of how much system resources vscode hogs up by the end of the day when I get many different projects open all at once.  Nothing against VSCode, it's a great product, it just takes a lot of resources.  Editors like VScode are great for editing full projects, but often I just want to quickly browse through a project with all of my favorite tools handy.  Even though this container is a bit bulky its startup performance has been superior to VSCode.
